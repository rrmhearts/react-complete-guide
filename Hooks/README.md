# More on State Batching & State Updates
React batches state updates - see: [https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10231#issuecomment-316644950]

That simply means that calling
```
setName('Max');
setAge(30);
```
in the same synchronous (!) execution cycle (e.g. in the same function) will **NOT trigger two component re-render cycles.**

Instead, the component will **only re-render once** and both state updates will be **applied simultaneously.**

Not directly related, but also sometimes misunderstood, is when the new state value is available.

Consider this code:
```
console.log(name); // prints name state, e.g. 'Manu'
setName('Max');
console.log(name); // ??? what gets printed? 'Max'?
```
You could think that accessing the name state after `setName('Max');` should yield the new value (e.g. `'Max'`) but this is **NOT the case.** Keep in mind, that the new state value is only available in the next component render cycle (which gets scheduled by calling `setName()`).

**Both concepts (batching and when new state is available) behave in the same way for both functional components with hooks as well as class-based components with** `this.setState()`**!**
